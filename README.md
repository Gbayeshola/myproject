This is my project on SQL for Northwind dataset.
This report is based on my analysis of the Northwind database using SQL queries.The main reason is to understand the dataset,get key information and find some important trends related to customers, products, employees, and orders.
Customer Insights:i find out all customer names and their IDs,customers living in London and list of all distinct countries our customers are from.I looked at how many orders each customer has placed and even identified customers who have placed more than 5 orders, which are our high-value customers, interesting finding was identifying customers who ordered 'Chai' (product promotions) and identified customers who have not placed any orders yet, which might be a good target for marketing.lastly,checked for the total freight amount paid by each customer and customers who placed orders consistently for three years (1996, 1997, and 1998).
Product Performance:I state all product names and their unit prices,products with less than 10 units in stock, which need urgent restocking,discontinued products, good for inventory management.I rank products by unit price to see the most expensive ones(5 most expensive products),the total quantity ordered for each product and the top 3 products by total quantity ordered.I calculated the total revenue generated by each product(product profitability) and found products where the reorder level is higher than the units in stock, showing items that need quick response.
Employee Activity:a list of employees hired after 1994,full names for all employees for easier identification,counted the total orders handled by each employee and tracked order counts per employee per year.
Order and Sales Analysis:I retrieved orders placed before 1997,checked the shipped dates and freight costs for all orders,grouped orders by OrderID to find those with more than 3 different products and also looked at the total quantity and total price for each order.
